# The Wild West of Finance

There is a new form of finance evolving as we speak that is changing the way humans move and store value. This new financial paradigm is controlled by no one and is un-censorable. It enables permissionless payments on a global scale, just as the internet has enabled anyone, anywhere to communicate, share ideas, and conduct commerce.

So what is the driving force behind this breakthrough? It's called the blockchain, and it's the driving technology behind a new form of money, called a cryptocurrency. The most famous of these is Bitcoin, which operates just like cash on the internet. You can send it anywhere around the globe virtually instantly and for almost no cost.

Bitcoin was created in 2009 and has continued to grow in network size and popularity because of how easy it is to use and because it is a superior form of money. Today, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies, although Bitcoin is by far the largest, most secure, and most used.

The goal of this site will be to help understand and explore the most cutting-edge ideas in this new world of finance, which puts the power of a Swiss bank account on a mobile phone. Not only is there tremendous opportunity in this space, but familiarizing yourself with cryptocurrencies now will put you ahead as they continue to disrupt the entire financial system as we know it.
